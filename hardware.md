I was using shift registers before to convert analog signal to digital to afford more lines of communication through the limited series of ports on the arduino

INS
6 analog INS and need sensor values read
-> sent to midi
Same for 10 digital ins (all push Buttons)

OUTS
digital pin 6 and 7 to addressable LEDs
